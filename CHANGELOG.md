## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

First implementation. Not published to npm yet, and the Tracive API is not live yet.

### Added

- `TraciveQuery` with factories for the five identifier types the Tracive API indexes — phone,
  e-mail, bank account, IBAN, crypto address and social handle — each folding its input into the
  exact key the server indexes and rejecting anything that could not match.
- `TraciveClient` with the four `Source` routing modes, per-tier caching, retry that refuses to run
  without an idempotency key, and single-flight token refresh on a 401.
- `TraciveOAuth`: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (S256 only), app-to-app authorization through the Tracive app,
  a pending record persisted before the browser hop so the flow survives process death, and
  cold-start link handling with duplicate suppression and a one-slot result buffer.
- A cache that is a billing feature: `InMemoryCheckCache` by default, `PersistentCheckCache` over
  any four-method `CheckCacheStore`, and per-record AES-256-GCM with the cache key bound into the
  additional authenticated data.
- Optional adapter subpaths for Expo (`expo-secure-store`, `expo-sqlite`, `expo-crypto`) and for
  bare React Native (`react-native-keychain`, `@op-engineering/op-sqlite`).
- `npx tracive-doctor`, a build-time checker for the host-app configuration that the SDK cannot
  supply and cannot verify at runtime, and an Expo config plugin that writes the same configuration
  during prebuild.
- Redacting `toJSON` and `toString` on every credential-bearing value, because JavaScript leaks
  through serialisation unless you opt out.
- The shared cross-SDK grammar fixture, pinned by sha256 and driving 33 vectors, 11 rejections and
  the record-key guard cases as executable tests.

### Notes

- ESM only. There is no CommonJS build.
- No native code, no autolinking, no podspec.
- There is no API key in this surface, in either mode.
